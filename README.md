This project follows along a youtube tutorial by freeCodeCamp on building a selenium+ java + TestNG automation framework from scratch. This project is using 'www.saucelabsdemo.com' as it to be tested website.

By now, we have created a base class containing find, set, and other webdriver APIs for basic element interactions. This base class is extended by other class and hence DRY principle is followed.

The other classes created are login and products page. Tests for each webpage is store in a different class.
